# Customer Churn Prediction and Salary Estimation with ANN
In this project I use Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to classify customer churn likelihood, as well as predict employee salaries. The solution is fine-tuned with Grid Search for optimal performance, and it includes an interactive deployment through Streamlit for ease of use and real-time predictions.

## Objectives
Churn Prediction: Develop an accurate classification model that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn.
Salary Prediction: Build a regression model to estimate salaries based on employee features, offering insights into compensation structures.

## Project parts/Features
- Basic data preprocessing
- Classification and regresion with neural network
- Finetuning Neural Network architecture
- Evaluating training process with Tensorboard
- Implementing a web nterface with streamlit

## Technology Stack
**TensorFlow/Keras**: Used for building, training, and fine-tuning the ANN models for both classification and regression.
**GridSearchCV**: Employed for hyperparameter tuning to optimize the ANN architecture.
**TensorBoard**: Integrated for real-time inspection of the training process and analysis of model metrics.
**Streamlit**: Provides a simple and effective UI for the model deployment, allowing users to interact with the churn classification and salary prediction functionalities.
